Thanks for stopping by my GitHub page and checking out some of my completed projects.
This past year has been one that many never saw coming. While working my full-time job, I ventured into taking a Full Stack Web Development 6 month bootcamp from UConn / Trilogy Services. This portfolio shows some of my completed group projects / assignments that showcases aspects of what was taught in the bootcamp. As well, as some of my older Graphic Design projects ranging from Packaging Labels, Signs, Marketing materials, etc. 
Thank you again for stopping by.
